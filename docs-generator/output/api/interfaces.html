<h2 id="core-interface-overview">Core Interface Overview</h2>
<h3 id="ievent">IEvent</h3>
<p>Base interface for all events in the system. Events are immutable data structures that represent something that happened in the domain.</p>
<h3 id="ieventhandlertstate-tevent">IEventHandler&lt;TState, TEvent&gt;</h3>
<p>Defines event handlers that transform aggregate state. Event handlers are pure functions that take the previous state and an event, returning the new state.</p>
<h3 id="ieventstore">IEventStore</h3>
<p>Manages event persistence and retrieval. The event store is responsible for appending events to streams and reading events for replay.</p>
<h3 id="isnapshotstore">ISnapshotStore</h3>
<p>Handles snapshot storage and retrieval. Snapshots are periodic captures of aggregate state used to optimize event replay performance.</p>
<h3 id="ihashprovider">IHashProvider</h3>
<p>Provides hash-based integrity verification. The hash provider ensures event handler code changes are detected and handles snapshot integrity verification.</p>
<h2 id="design-principles">Design Principles</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Immutability</strong>: All events and snapshots are immutable</li>
<li><strong>Pure Functions</strong>: Event handlers are pure functions with no side effects</li>
<li><strong>Hash Verification</strong>: All components support hash-based integrity checking</li>
<li><strong>Async-First</strong>: All I/O operations are asynchronous by default</li>
<li><strong>Type Safety</strong>: Strong typing throughout with generic support</li>
</ul>
